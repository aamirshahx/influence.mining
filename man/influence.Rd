\usage{
influence(
  graph,
  budget = 1,
  prob = 0.5,
  steps = 1,
  optimal_solution = FALSE,
  test_method = c("RESILIENCE", "INFLUENCE_LT", "INFLUENCE_IC"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{is the igraph object}

\item{budget}{number of influential nodes to be fetched. Default value is 1}

\item{prob}{probability at which a node influences its neighbours}

\item{steps}{is the time steps for which, the diffusion process should run. Provide NULL for exhaustive run. Default value is 1}

\item{optimal_solution}{should be TRUE if influential nodes are to be derived using optimal algorithm. Caution! This is the slowest apporach}

\item{test_method}{specifies the method to measure influence. Value MUST be "RESILIENCE", "INFLUENCE_IC" or "INFLUENCE_LT"}

\item{heuristic}{specifies the heuristic method used for influence calculation. Required only when optimal_solution is FALSE}

\item{centrality_method}{is the centrality algorithm to use when heuristic is "CENTRALITY" or "ADAPTIVE_CENTRALITY". Value must be "DEGREE", "BETWEENNESS", "CLOSENESS" or "EIGENVECTOR"}

\item{parallel}{when true, executes the funtion using multiple CPU cores. Default value is TRUE}

\item{logging}{when true, a complete log is stored in output.log file}
}
\value{
